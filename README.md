## My process

1. At first I wrote out psuedo code to break the assignment down.
2. After this I installed the necessary packages, and made the server.js file and got it working.
3. I followed this by getting the routes working, getting through the GET's first and the POST last.
4. I then got UUID set up to use for the id's, then deployed to Heroku.
5. I finished by finishing the README and adding some comments

### Built with

- Node.js
- Express.js

### What I learned

- Exercise was good to practice routing and setting up a server

### Continued development

- More work with routing.

### Useful resources

- Google, there was a lot of useful information about how to do the routing and other stuff when I was having issues.
